# Face Recognition Attendance System

## 🎯 Overview
The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a robust and efficient application built using **Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, and MySQL** that automates attendance tracking with facial recognition. Leveraging the **Haar Cascade algorithm**, it detects faces and marks attendance seamlessly. The system offers multiple functionalities, including:


✅ **Student Dashboard** – Manage student details
✅ **Attendance** – Track and store attendance records
✅ **Developer Contact** – Get in touch with the creator
✅ **Exit** – Secure logout and exit
✅ **Train Data** – Train the model with new face data
✅ **Photos** – Store and retrieve captured face images

## 📌 Features
🔹 **User-friendly Interface** – Built with Tkinter for easy navigation.
🔹 **Real-time Face Recognition** – Uses OpenCV for live detection.
🔹 **Secure Data Storage** – MySQL database integration.
🔹 **Export Data** – Convert attendance records to CSV and Excel.
🔹 **Photo Storage** – Captures and stores images for training.
🔹 **Haar Cascade Algorithm** – Ensures accurate face detection.

## 📌 How It Works
1️⃣ **Train the Model** – Collect student images and train the system.
2️⃣ **Detect Faces** – Uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade for recognition.
3️⃣ **Mark Attendance** – Recognized faces are logged into the database.
4️⃣ **View Attendance** – Retrieve records via the dashboard.
5️⃣ **Export to CSV/Excel** – Convert stored data for analysis.
